# isPot-

Python scripts for downloading images of greek vases, cleaning the data, and (eventually) running a CNN on it.

If one uses the scripts here to scrape the images, please be polite.  The website that holds them is small and probably unable
to support a rapid scrape.  They are so small they don't even have a robots.txt
I aimed to download 1 image about every 2 seconds, and the entire process took about 4 days.  Please be patient, and if you can,
use a longer delay.

requester is a tool using the requests library\n
potGetter was used to download the image urls\n
potPicGetter downloads the images\n
imagePrep is used clean, sort, and split the images. This section is still in development\n

Please note, image prep refers to an /images directory which is not currently 
uploaded (as some images are copyrighted and I obviously do not have rights).
